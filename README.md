# Genetic_lifeform_sim
Authors: Emil Dulguerov, Jason Schneider

A project that creates little lifeforms in a simple simualted environment. These lifeforms have genetic characteristics related to brain, muscle and bone size which affects vision, decision making, carrying capacity (for food), fighting capability, visual appearance and travel capability. These lifeforms move, eat, reproduce and die (of age, starvation, or predation) passing on their genetic traits.
